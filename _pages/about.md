I am currently a Technical Research Associate at MIT working with [Prof. Evelina Fedorenko](https://evlab.mit.edu/). My research interests can be split into 3 main branches: 1) understanding the neural correlates and computations that allow for efficient and effective language use behaviors, 2) applying this knowledge to improving outcomes for atypical and clinical populations for whom language use is impaired, and 3) aggregating these findings with evolutionary biology and philosophy to develop an account of cognitive-communicative evolution in both human and non-human animals.

Before coming to MIT, I spent 2 years at Vanderbilt University as the Lab Manager for the Conversation lab with [Prof. Sarah Brown_schmidt](https://www.sarahbrownschmidt.com/). Our work focused on understanding the differences in processing demands between language comprehension and production in both neurotyipcal populations and people with traumatic brain injury (TBI).

I completed my BS in neurosceince with a minor in linguistics in 2023 at the University of Southern California. There, I worked in the Psycholingusitics of Mono- and Multilingualism Lab with [Prof. Zuzanna Fuchs](https://www.zuzannazfuchs.com/) studying how noun classification systems such as grammatical gender are instantiated in the grammars of monolingual and multilingual speakers. I also worked in the [Laboratory of Neuroimaging](https://loni.usc.edu/) under Prof. Jeiran Choupan and Prof. Kirsten Lynch studying the relationship between perivascular space (PVS) size and cerebrovasculature caliber.

In my work, I am committed to doing open science that is interdisciplinary, rigorous, and collaborative.
